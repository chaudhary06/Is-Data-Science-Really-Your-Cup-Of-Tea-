# Is-Data-Science-Really-Your-Cup-Of-Tea-

As Data Science is 21st Century Sexiest Job and it's the Booming Domain in Current Industry, and everyone out there getting attracted towards this field without knowing it from the ground but we must say there are a lot of courses out there in the market with the assurance of job guarantee.

But some of the False statement you will find in the market like "Without Tech Skills You Can Become The Data Scientist", which doesn't make any sense for you to get into it. If you are planning to join any Course that is fine but before that, you have to be clear "Whether Data Science Is Your Cup Of Tea Or Not", so that the amount you are going to spend on it should be worth it for you to learn new things as well as to switch your career.

First of all, you have to be clear WHY DATA SCIENCE?

Is it just because having a Higher Salary Package in Industry!! If you think so and moving ahead, you are on the wrong track. There are always two things why you are choosing this field just because you are interested or it's looking interested from outside?? Be Clear with your WHY?? and you are good to land with this Domain.

Within WHY DATA SCIENCE!! There are a lot of questions you have to explore for better future opportunities!!

What is Data Science and How Data Scientist Work??

It depends on how you see Data Science from your perspective to land with this domain.

Data Science consists of Business Knowledge, Mathematics, statistics and programming skills to find out insights to deal with the Required Business Problem.

"Before Being A Data Scientist, Be A Good Data Storyteller."

Data Science is not New in the Market, But Yes the name is Really fascinating and interesting with interesting tools to deal with. Before Data Scientist there was "Statistician" and Now replaced by "Data Science".The major and common part was to deal with strong statistic and probability concepts to find out insight to deal with the required problem. 

Let's work out with some example:: Assume that you own a "Car Service Centre" and on daily basis, you are getting 300 customers but after sometime 150-200 customers increasing per day, the employee will work from 9 to 5 and you cannot increase the number of employees!!

So, here is a Data Science problem to make your revenue stream stable and hiring "N" number of an employee doesn't seem to fulfil customer requirements and your revenue stream as well. As a Data Scientist how you will solve this problem let's have a look::

1.) The very simple approach will be identifying what is the major problem on a daily basis you are getting let's say more car with "Engine Problem" or Any Other etc...By analysing you can figure out and identify respective to which particular domain you need more employee (let's say you can analyse you have to hire employee related to "Engine Problem") and this will help you out to hire "Particular Employee" instead of hiring "N Number Of Employees".

2.)Secondly, you can work with such a model which will help you out that which car need an "Urgent Service Or Not", in return which will help to save time for your employee.

So, what are the benefits you got from above two points for your "Car Service Centre":

1.)You can analyse to hire "Particular Employee" instead of hiring "N Number Of Employee".

2.)You can create a model which will predict which car needs an "Urgent Service Or Not", in return which will save your employee time.

Let's work out with Another Real Time Example to understand Data Science and What Data Scientist Do?

1.1)Did you think over once, How Companies Like Nokia, Samsung, etc... predicting their New Product Price?? Is some Founder will come and say Let's Sell This Product For 12k or 20k?

Above is a Data Science Problem(1.1)(Which includes Business problem(How to Predict Price of a Product to Retain a Profit from the Product).

If you are a Company Owner you will be Having Simple Approach and you will launch your product for very Less Price as compared to other product available, then what is the Probability that Customer will Buy your Product?, "Product with Less Price doesn't prove that customer will buy your product and here you lose your identity in the Market.

Here what Data Scientist Analyse:

1.) The very first phase is any organization will set some sort of Profit Percentage about 20% or 30%(Which means if an organization get a profit of at least 20% or 30% then only they will launch the product otherwise not).We can call this step as "Hypothesis Testing"(Important part of statistic to learn about).

2.)Secondly, Organization will work on their old customer who bought their previous product and here as well they will set some sort of "Fixed Customer", Like out of 10 lakh customers at least 50 thousand or 1 lakh customer should buy the Product to retain profit for the product(which is again known to be as "Hypothesis Testing").

"Data Scientist will understand the "Business Problem" and apply Statistic and Probability knowledge to find out the different insights to work with product segmentation.

If you are Newbee to start with, you are more concerned about "Which Programming Language To Start With."

But As a Data Scientist "Analytical Approach" is the very first phase to start with."Good Programming Skill With Zero Analytical Approach Couldn't land you to the Desire Job as a Data Scientist."Technical Skill" is the Second Phase to start with if you are too strong with creative Approach to solve the desired problem as a Data Scientist.

If you are Newbee and want to start with this Domain, Here are the steps to get in??

1.)Start reading Blogs on a Daily basis and try to understand the domain from the ground, try to find out some alternative solutions for the existing one. Maybe you won't get the stuff but when you work continuously, you will start thinking and understand the stuff in a different manner.

2.)To be a Data Scientist Analytical Approach is must and you will get it Master after reading Blogs, Research Papers, Learn and try to find a new solution to an existing one and implement it.

3.)Maybe you are confused which “Programming Language” you should Master to start with??

4.)But “Best Programmer with Less Analytics Thinking as Well as Statistics and Probability Concept is Not a Good Data Scientist”.So, the very first phase to think like a "Data Scientist" then took one step ahead with "Tech" to implement.

5.)So, focus on Statistics and Probability with “Practical Approach” as well as "Theoretical Approach".

6.)Here is the Website Link form where you can start your Journey If you are Fresher reading out Articles, Blogs and understanding the domain from the ground, https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/, https://stattrek.com/("Teach yourself Statistics") and https://www.mckinsey.com/.

7.)Do Not follow Multiple stuff at a time otherwise, you will get confused. Start with one Finish it, google for the problems and concept you didn’t get.

If you are “Fresher” this is right Approach, follow it for a couple of months. And you can understand every problem from ground related to Data Science.

Let's work out with interesting "Case Study", Did you observe how service providers like "AIRTEL and IDEA" manage to provide different offers for the particular customer over millions of customers? (Many times you may be getting the offer for 450 Rs and same offer to your friend or family will get for 350 Rs from AIRTEL as an example)!! Why This Happen??

So, let's understand what is churn?

If you are switching from "AIRTEL" to "IDEA", it is known to be as churn for service providers.

If you are switching then "CHURN RATE = 1"(Which means Customer will stop subscribing services from the particular service provider), If not "CHURN RATE = 0"(Which means Customer will not stop subscribing services from the particular service provider).

So, churn prediction and prevention is very crucial for the business to generate revenue.

This is a Data Science Problem and let's see some interesting steps as a Data Scientist to work with.

We can analyse from the above problem that to predict whether a particular customer is going to change the service provider or not becomes a major challenge to work with as a Data Scientist with a required business problem.

In simple words, we have to predict customers who are going out of the services in future and focus on them to get back to use services again.

Here will be having three major "Business Challenges" as follows:

1.)Prepaid Customers(the number of individual using prepaid services is more and have to focus on such customers to continue revenue generation from a fixed number of customers for any service provider it's an important and major factor to work with such customers).

2.)Postpaid Customers(number will be small but another important factor not to lose such individual who is continue revenue generation for the service provider, under this we can easily target such people to being with the same service provider with some advance customer support for them.)

3.)Early churn phenomenon (which means there are many service providers who use to give some "FREE" offers for a week but many customers are very smart they use such service for a week then they switch to another and which is going to be "LOSS" for any service provider in the market. So, this is the major challenge to predict if any service provider is giving such offers to the customers then what is the probability that after using "FREE SERVICES" for a week they will recharge it again and if such kind of behaviour noticed then it is called as "Fraud Activation" because of which organization have to suffer a "Good Loss").

What are the important features for better prediction whether customer "CHURN RATE = '1' OR '0'?

1.)Active Days:: Total revenue generation when the customer is active to use services.

2.)Average Call Distance:: Time between two consecutive calls which will help to predict the revenue or profit per month per customer.

3.)Maximum Inactive Days:: To figure out the total consecutive number of inactive days to predict on an average fixed revenue per customer.

4.)Network Age:: Important feature as it will tell how old is the customer and if the customer is new, facing some problem while using services(here we have to take care of such customers as they can leave the service provider anytime).On the other hand, the chance of an old customer to switch service provider is very less and here we can assign customer "Resolution" as "Urgent or Not" based on how old is the customer as well problem while using the service provider.

5.)Alpha:: It can be named anything "Alpha" is nothing just analysing "Month To Month" profit per customer for revenue prediction even better to retain regular customer and providing such offers to them so that they won't switch to another service provider.

Small study to find out "Churn Prediction" and it needs patience, understanding of business problem and understanding of data set you are having.

In addition to reading blogs, research papers and real-time cases related to know what is Data Science and how Data Scientist work?

What are the initial Tools/Software and Programming Language to start with?

One of the best platform to work with is "Anaconda" which includes more than 1000 packages for a Data Scientist and usually, we worked with "Jupyter Notebook"(Best platform to visualise and you can work with Python or R).

1.)You must start learning Python or R, but as experience must start with python and as per industry python is a mandatory bonus with R.

2.)SQL is the basic language you should start learning to play with Data Set and you should know advance SQL. But no need to learn advance SQL just play with different Data Set and you will learn it side by side.

3.)At initial stage start learning "Tableau" which is a powerful visualization tool and it will help you out to find out insight within Data.

4.)You have to learn "Machine Learning" from scratch and be more clear about what is ML. As a Data Scientist "Machine Learning" is just 20% of your work and rest 80% of your work is to understand the Business problem, Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Visualization.

4.)As a fresher just master above three points for a couple of months and work on some good projects to enhance your skill within same.

5.)Do not jump on Spark or Hadoop part of Big Data at the same time, be clear that "Data Science is a Building Block Of Big Data".

6.)First master Python, SQL, Tableau and Machine Learning work with a different project to enhance your skill in the same.

7.)If you worked with the above steps then you don't want anyone to guide you to further after working out with projects and easily you can choose yourself to move ahead.

Before Predicting any Model With ML, you have to understand the Business problem and Analyze it with three simple steps::

1)Think from a Business perspective and make some hypothesis("Hypothesis is nothing just making some assumption and dealing with the required business problem").

2)Think from a customer perspective and make some hypothesis.

3)Think from your perspective and make some hypothesis!!

The hypothesis you are going to make may be wrong but it will give you a Different Idea to deal with Required Problem which in turn into analytical Thinking.

Steps you should Follow to solve any Data Science Problem or Any Project as follows::

1)Search out Research Paper and Documentation Related to Particular Data Science Problem.

2)Read it out and understand the business problem. Make some Hypothesis to start with.

3)Try to make a Flow Chart after Reading Research Paper, which in return help you a lot to build analytical thinking and that is what Data Scientist have to do!! (Bonus Step which can make you different from the crowd).

4)Afterwards, import your Data into excel and again make some hypothesis, tends to be wrong but will be helpful to understand the required problem very clearly.

5)Do Visualize Data with Tableau which in turn will help you to make a crazy hypothesis which will help you to identify which parameter affecting your output variable.

6)Import your Data Set to "Jupyter Notebook Using Python" and play with Data using SQL.

Biggest mistake individual do is they directly import Data Set into "Jupyter" and play with Data using Python and SQL but losing analytical approach which you will learn by following the first 5 steps before importing Data Set.

So, what you are waiting for "Start Your Journey And Find Out Whether Data Science Is Your Cup Of Tea Or Not".
